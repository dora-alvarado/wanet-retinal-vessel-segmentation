## AdamW optimizer and cosine learning rate annealing with restarts

This folder contains an implementation of AdamW optimization algorithm and cosine learning rate scheduler described 
in ["Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101). 

The code was developed by Maksym Pyrozhok and is available in 
[https://github.com/mpyrozhok/adamwr](https://github.com/mpyrozhok/adamwr).
